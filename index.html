            <span><strong>Intro</strong></span><br>   
            <p>The current Mysuru Palace – the fourth to occupy this site – was designed by the British architect Henry Irwin after its predecessor was destroyed in a fire in 1897.<br><br> The imposing building that stands today was completed in 1912, but it is believed that a Mysuru Palace was established as part of a wooden fortress, by the royal family of Mysuru, the Wodeyars, as early as the fourteenth century.</p></discription1>

                <span><strong>Wodiyar dynasty</strong></span><br>    
            <p>The Wodiyar dynasty (also spelt Wadiyar by the British) was an Indian royal dynasty that ruled the Kingdom of Mysuru from 1399 to 1947, until the independence of India from British rule and the subsequent unification of Indian dominion and princely states into the Republic of India.</p></discription2>

                <span><strong>History</strong></span><br>    
            <p>The Vijayanagara Empire disintegrated in 1565. The power vacuum created soon after was utilized by Raja Wadiyar, who ruled Mysuru from 1578 to 1617.<br><br> He expanded the borders of the Mysuru kingdom and also shifted the capital from the city of Mysuru in 1610 to Srirangapatna, a rare island formed by the river Cauvery , which provided natural protection against military attacks.</p></discription3>
